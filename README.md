# testrep -- LAB 2
# README

This repo was created on github.com and is named "testrep" because I am practicing building a repository and working on it in VScode, my local environment. 

In the subdirectory, I have two folders. They are named Homework and Labs and they are a part of the testrep repository.

For this repo, I can easily send information to the github public. 

I use three commands. They are the following:

git add *
git commit -a -m "comment"
git push

and that is it!
